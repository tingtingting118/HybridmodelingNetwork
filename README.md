Fitting Hybrid model for 3 network dataset



I will fit some hybrid degree distributions using a few different datasets.
Please use the three attached comma-delimited files: 
1) Prisoner data studied by MacRae (1960): Macrae_table5.5_mjbook.csv,
2) Co-authorship network studied by Goyal et al.: Coauthorship_GoyalEtAl.csv, and 
3) Ham radio network data collected by Killworth and Bernard : HamRadioOperators_Killworth.csv.
This lab is based on content covered in session 7, and sections 5.1-5.3 of Matthew Jacksonâ€™s textbook ( Social Economics Network)
